initial v1 - not working properly. oonly detectign zeros for some reason even though a array of scores is declared.
initial v2 - properly working. It was found that the score was not initialized previoulsy in v1 and the program decided to insert garbage values or zeros to recuperate. fixed by inserting score = arr_scores[i][j]

test1 v1 - a standard user input of transmuted scores by inputting scores and transferring to a 5x5 2D array . Issues encountwered only included syntax errors and improper detail of indesis in the code. bottom loop function is for assurance that the inputed scores are detected correctly and in order of the array.
